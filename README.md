# Image-Segmentation implement in C# and F#

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. The goal is to assign a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. Segmentation changes the image into something more meaningful and easier to analyse.

Example: Segment a satellite image
